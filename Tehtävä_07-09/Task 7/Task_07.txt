    Modify the code of the JS-REACT-P-CREATEELEMENT-1 task above so that you fill the list item values by using an array sqlsThreats
    instead of hardcoding the strings. Use JavaScriptâ€™s Array.map function. Add also the key properties. Check browser console for
    possible warnings. You can search help from the book example listings.

    What does it mean that ReactDOM.render works smart?

    ReactDOM.render lets developers to keep data and UI elements separate. This results that we can work our data and UI will update after it.
    ReactDOM.render update only the smallest amount of elements required to display the data changes. Basically changing data doesn't necessarily
    mean whole page will update but only one element.
