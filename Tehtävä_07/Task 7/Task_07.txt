    Modify the code of the JS-REACT-P-CREATEELEMENT-1 task above so that you fill the list item values by using an array sqlsThreats instead of hardcoding the strings. Use JavaScriptâ€™s Array.map function. Add also the key properties. Check browser console for possible warnings. You can search help from the book example listings.
