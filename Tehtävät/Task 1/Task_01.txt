1. JS-GENERAL-T-BASICS-1.

Explain the following JavaScript code clips in your own words.
Tell what is the value of variable currentPort in part e.
What does the part f print on the console? (2 pts):

a.      “intomieli”
        Quotations are use to declare string type variable.
        In this instance actual variable is not defined but one could insert "intomieli" into one i.e. let x = "intomieli"                      

b.      ==  
        Double equal sign is used to compare two values.
        This does not take in consideration the type of the value i.e. "3" == 3 would return true.                                 

c.      ===
        Triple equal sign does same as double version
        except it also checks the type of the values and compare those too i.e. "3" === 3 would return false.                                          

d.      “Se” + “ “ + “on” + “ “ + “totta” + “.”;
        Items inside quotations are strings and empty quotations with space will result actual space.
        The addition sign will add values surrounding it together. In this case the end result will print out: Se on totta.

e.      var port = 3001; var currentPort = port || 3000;
        Two variables are declared; port and currentPort.
        The currentPort can be port OR 3000. Double vertical lines mark OR operator in js.
        The value of currentPort is 3001 as it is first to return true in the statement.

f.       var saldo = 0;
           if (saldo) {
               console.log(“Rahaa on”);
          } else {
               console.log(“Rahaa ei ole”);
          }

          Print out: Rahaa ei ole. The variable saldo is 0. When saldo is checked as true/false statement the 0 value translates as false.


2. JS-GENERAL-T-BASICS-2.
Look at the following code clip. Does it work? If not, why, and how could you fix it? (2 pts):

let number = 5;
const cNumber = 5;
console.log(number * cNumber);
cNumber = 6;
console.log(number * cNumber);

It does not work. Reason being the cNumber is a constant variable.
This type of variables cannot be re-declared once declared i.e. cNumber = 6; will not change the value.
Easy fix would be changing the const to let or var type. That is if const ins't required as type for this variable.


3. JS-GENERAL-P-BASICS-1.
Write the following programs. Use loops. Include source code and screenshots from results (2 pts):

a. Output even numbers from 20 to 200 to console. (1 point) -> Loopy.js

b. Sum items from array deposits while the sum is less than 100.
(Add the following deposit to sum if the sum of deposits is before addition less than 100.)
Here on possible example of an array: deposits = [ 12.11, 34.22, 31.95. 50.00, 22.50, 200.00 ] (1 point) -> ArraySum.js


4. JS-GENERAL-P-BASICS-2.
Make exercise “FizzBuzz” from book (Exercises, chapter 2).  (2 pts) -> FizzBuzz.js


5. JS-ARRAY-T-BASICS-2 (1 point)

a. Can the same array contain numbers and objects at the same time?
Yes.

b. Give one example of a method of an Array object that modifies the array in place,
and one example of a method that modifies a copy (returns a modified copy of the array).

numbers[2].sort() -> sorts elements in place and return sorted reference.
numbers[2].toUpperCase(); -> returns copy of the element in upper case.

c. When checking the length of an array, are you utilizing an attribute of an array or a method of an array?

arr.lenght is property of an array. When used one is utilizing an attribute of an array.


6. JS-ARRAY-P-ARRAY-PROPERTIES-1 (2 points)

Lets have an array distances = [ 165, 626, 148, 12, 81, 181 ].

a. Write a code clip that returns the length of the array. (0,5 points)

b. Write code clip that adds the distances 8, 533 and 76 into the end of the array and in this order.
One distance at a time. Use one the array methods. (0,5 points)

c. Write a code clip that removes the number 148 from the array. Use array methods.
A tip: One of the methods to use could be splice. (1 points) -> ArrayProperties.js
