    In your operations logic, when should you use if statements and when error handling? Give a justified explanation.

        When if statement can return valid result all the times it can be used. In case of 'index out of bounds' possibility I
        would first try the statement and then write error handling for 'index out of bounds' cases. Otherwise my program will fail at error.

2. JS-ERROR-P-LEAPYEAR-1 (2 points)

    In the practical exercise 2 the task 1 (JS-FUNCTION-P-LEAPYEAR-1) was to program a function isLeapYear. The function accepted one argument year.

    Develop this function further so that it can throw two different kinds of errors when called incorrectly.
    If the function is called without a parameter, then an error with a message “Missing argument year error” is thrown.
    If the function is called with non-integer argument, then an error with a message “Non-integer argument year error” is thrown.
    In this case, write the try-catch statement inside the function and output the error message on the console.

    Please note that an argument value 0 should not be considered as an error. -> leapYear.html

    Return to the task above. Change the implementation so that the try-catch is moved to an enclosing operation tryIsLeapYear.
    The errors are still thrown inside the isLeapYear operation. -> leapYear2.html

    Return to the task above and change the implementation so that also throwing the error is done in the enclosing operation tryIsLeapYear.

5.  JS-ERROR-T-ERROR-COMPARE-FUNCTIONS-1 (1 point)

    Compare the ways of handling errors above. What are main differences when writing and using them.

        First and third ways seem the most easy to write and manage as the whole functionality of error testing happen in single function.
        The second way of testing in one function and throwing errors in another seems redundant due to the fact whole thing can be
        done in single function instead.

6. JS-REGEX-T-EXPLAIN-1 (2 points)

    Explain shortly:

    a. How regular expressions consume their input? (What is the mechanism of matching?)
        Regex comsume only string with regular characters. Special characters can be used but need backlash to turn them to comsumable form.

    b. What do parentheses around any part of the regular expression cause?
        Parentheses creates a group.

    c. What is the difference between lazy matching and greedy matching in regular expressions?
        In Greedy mode regex finds all cases that match and then moves from end towards the start until it has found enough as described by quantifier.
        This can lead to unintended matches at times when there are multiple possible matches in material.

        In Lazy mode regex finds first match and moves forward to next match. It goes one by one instead of first going
        through whole material and working backwards like Greedy does.

    d. When do you need to use RegExp constructor like new RegExp() instead of regular expression literal like / /?

        Constructor is needed when material contains regular string that has special characters that can be ignored.

7. JS-REGEX-P-BUILD-REGISTER-NUMBER-1 (2 points)

    Develop a function buildRegisterNumber so that it can throw two different kinds of errors when called with incorrect argument values.
    The function takes two arguments: theLetters and theDigits. If the value of theLetters argument is not valid, then an error
    with a message “Invalid register number letters” is thrown. If the value of theDigits argument is not valid, then an error with
    a message “Invalid register number digits” is thrown. In case the arguments are valid, then a valid register number is returned.

    Use regular expressions to validate the argument values.

    Let’s agree that a valid register number obeys the following rules

    ·        there are from two to three uppercase letters before a dash

    ·        the letter W is not allowed

    ·        a dash

    ·        there are from one to three digits after the dash

    ·        no leading zeros are allowed (no zeros before first non-zero digit)

    

    Examples of valid register numbers:

    AX-12

    UUI-6

    GFS-200

    Examples of invalid register numbers:

    X-100

    YUT-020
